TransAudio - Effortless AI-Powered Transcription.

TransAudio is your go-to web app for seamless speech-to-text conversion. Upload your audio files and let TransAudio quickly do the magic, with high accuracy. This is a work in progress, and I'll be adding more features soon.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Features

For now, the web app has the following features:

```bash
- upload an audio file of type/mp3 or type/mp4;

- after uploading, the app will transcribe the audio file;

- the app will display the transcription results;

- the final transcription results will be displayed, with confidence scores and server runtime;

- you can download the transcription results as a text file or copy it off the clipboard;
```

That's it for now.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

Get started for free by visiting my website: [https://transaudio.geltaverse.com](https://transaudio.geltaverse.com) and upload an audio file less than 8MB of size. Let me know what you think.
