The accuracy of your transcription is directly related to the quality of your audio recording. Follow these tips to get the best results from TransAudio.

## Choose the Right Environment

- Select a quiet location with minimal background noise
- Avoid rooms with hard surfaces that create echo
- Turn off fans, air conditioners, or other noisy equipment
- Close windows to block outside noise
- Consider using a dedicated meeting room with acoustic treatment

## Use Proper Recording Equipment

- For individual recordings, use a decent headset or external microphone
- For meetings, use conference microphones designed to capture multiple speakers
- Position microphones close to speakers when possible
- Test your equipment before important recordings
- Consider using a pop filter for clearer consonant sounds

## Recording Techniques

- Ask speakers to talk clearly and at a moderate pace
- Introduce speakers before they talk for easier identification
- Avoid multiple people speaking simultaneously
- For remote meetings, request participants to mute when not speaking
- Consider recording in a higher bit rate for better audio quality

## File Preparation

- Trim unnecessary silence from the beginning and end
- Split very long recordings into manageable segments
- Save files in MP3 format at 128kbps or higher
- Check file size is under the 8MB limit for TransAudio's standard processing
