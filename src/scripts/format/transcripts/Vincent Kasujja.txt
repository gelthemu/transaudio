Interviewer: [00:01]
Ah yes. You're going to help me. You're going to go ahead to tell me about yourself. A little background about your training and then your area of specialty and then your years of practice, then you just dive in.

Participant: [00:19]
Okay.

Interviewer: [00:20]
Yeah.

Participant: [00:22]
So if you are good to go. I'm good to go.

Interviewer: [00:24]
I am good to go. Please go ahead.

Participant: [00:28]
Good. So good morning and you're talking to Captain Vincent Kasuja and I'm a military psychologist in practice. As a practice. I practice as a clinical psychologist from Makerere University. I've taken something like now 10 years in practice as a clinical psychologist, probably mission areas like Mogadishu. I've been a clinical psychologist there then at UPDF, I work at General Military Hospital Bombo as a psychologist and also working with the Directorate of hiv handling those clients with mental problems on. On treatment. HIV treatment.

Interviewer: [01:25]
Okay.

Participant: [01:25]
Briefly. That's it. Unless there's something you wanted to know more.

Interviewer: [01:32]
Okay. Since that it's. So basically you've worked in deployments but the same time you placed in hospital like Bombo.

Participant: [01:41]
Yeah, yeah. Giving clinical services.

Interviewer: [01:44]
Yeah. But then still you participate, you practice with HIV.

Participant: [01:50]
Yeah. Handling those with issues with adherence and psychosis

Interviewer: [02:02]
Okay. Yeah.

Participant: [02:04]
And also.

Interviewer: [02:08]
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Just to take. So we are going to dive into our discussion point, at least I know your background. So just kindly share with me what inspired you to share your therapeutic experience and how you think it can help others.

Participant: [02:35]
Oh yeah, yeah. Basically based on my background working with different military guys, working with the veterans, working with the families, I thought put it wise that really if I come out I probably share some of my experiences, it can be a very good backbone for such members. For my colleagues that have qualified as the probably clinical psychologists to be like a platform to see how they can also handle their people better. Based on my experience, based on what I've shared, probably if they are my colleagues, they can handle better. If they are these others, like the veterans, like the service members, they can pick on that to see how far they can probably utilize the services because most of them, they have that kind of stigma and misconceptions about the services. But when we come out and we share what we can do, it is a kind of normalizing of the situation so that at least mental health services can be seeked, can be accessed and people know more about and the therapy, the psychotherapy and how it can do better, how it can help others, our colleagues, our Ugandans. So I think it was wise if I come out and share what is happening, what we do and what services are available. Otherwise some people have some misconception about the service. So coming out like this and we share the experiences kinds of normalizes the situation and probabilities a basis of others, especially those who are training also to see what we go through and they find way of also coming on board and handle it.

Interviewer: [04:28]
Thank you so much. So you've gone ahead. No, you've gone ahead. Thank you so much for sharing. So you're still going ahead to talk about the next discussion and then. But I'd like to ask you how best on, besides sharing, how best do you think we can locally document the therapeutic experience?

Participant: [04:50]
Can you come again? Okay.

Interviewer: [04:53]
Yes. How do you think local documentation of therapeutic experiences can contribute to the development of mental health practice in Uganda? I know you tried to bring in your previous sharing, but maybe just in case you had, you had planned something more clear or something direct to it, you just go ahead and share.

Participant: [05:12]
Exactly when, when you come out and document something on the ground, it is more valuable and for sure it broadens the aspects of other people who are going to do probably research and also most of the judgment, the documentation which is on the ground, most of the theories which are on the ground there, these are Western, of Western setting. So when you come down on the ground and probably show the challenges, what we can adapt, the successes, the evidence kind of practice we do down here, it is very beneficial. And also to the policymakers, like in the military, we don't have too much of it which is written down. But if we come out like this and we share the challenges, we share the success stories, it is a basis whereby we can based on that, probably to lobby for support, also to show out that this is really very, very much important based on what we have noted down, based on what we have shared. If I come out and probably we note some challenges on the issues we face before troops go for missions, after mission and all that, it probably gives a basis or it informs the leadership, the army leadership and get to know where they need to probably inject more money when, where they need to put emphasis. So it is very, very much important for us to come out and put something on the ground to show that this and this, this is the way we go. These are successful stories. We always meet with the clients and that's all.

Interviewer: [06:50]
Thank you. Thank you for highlighting that. So still moving on.

Participant: [06:54]
Probably, probably also probably to the colleagues we work with, like the psychiatrists, these other providers, they also pick something and they get to know what we are doing. And in case of any, any referral, you, you narrow that gap. You bridge that gap which has been existing for long.

Interviewer: [07:14]
Yeah.

Participant: [07:14]
So that in case you are sending someone can know that at least this, they do this. Therapy is all about this.

Interviewer: [07:20]
Thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah. So next we are moving on to what some, what are some of the unique challenges you have come that come with seeking therapy in your. Most especially in your area of practice? You're being in the military. I don't know whether it would be seen as something like someone would be forced to step down, yet it would be more than normal. Like you get malaria. The same way with stress and depression could be related to physical health. So I'm wondering what child, what unique challenges come with seeking for therapy in your area of practice?

Participant: [08:01]
This other side may be stigma. I don't know if that's why it is the same stigma. The challenge of stigma. You find that this other side, it is too much. People are like they, they don't come out easily. They don't come out easily just because there is that kind of, how can I say it? But there is that kind of. There's a way they seek as if you, you're weak. If a soldier comes out to sick services or mental health and they are worried that probably at one time it will affect their career, so they don't easily come out. They fear that probably it can be used as an elimination method or to. It can affect their promotion so they don't come out. Then also accessing these mental health professionals, we don't so many. I think even in Uganda, they're not so many as in the entire community, we are not so many. So accessing them and where they are deployed, the soldiers, where they are deployed, it is far away. So you can't easily. They can't easily access clinical psychologists. So it is a little bit tricky to us. But what we always do, we try to say that at least we sensitize them when it comes to stigma and we talk to them and we see the way you see, you seek other services, physical services is the way someone can get these others and where the ultimate goal is all about to make you better so that you can go back for deployment, you can go back for your work. So when you sensitize them, when you talk about them, you make it normal. It's like any other services, physical service, they tend, they turn out to come out and say, oh, it's good. So that's why we say that documentation is always better. If we come out, we sensitize our, our leadership about all the, about Mental health and how therapy is available and accessible and how it can help our soldiers. I think it is very, very much important and can help out.

Interviewer: [10:10]
Thank you. Thank you. So still, how do you think, what are the benefits that you've seen that have come with seeking for therapy in Uganda still in your area?

Participant: [10:23]
Yeah. Okay. The benefits, for sure. Like for example, where I've told you that at least the first, there's that issue of stigma. So if we come out and we sensitize them and we provide the service and they see that at least they are getting. They're getting better, people will access these services more and more. And for our soldiers, at least it can help out. If they're from the mission areas and they are handled better before they are taken back to the committee, before they go to their families. It minimizes these issues of every now and then people shooting to each other, killing families, killing girlfriends, which dominates a lot of newspapers and on televisions, that soldiers are really shooting recklessly. So if we handle them from the mission areas before we are sent back to the community, I think it is very, very much beneficial. Otherwise, these are our brothers, these are people we stay with, these are parents, these are our relatives. So we need to handle them better mentally before we put them back to the community. Or we send them back to the community.

Interviewer: [11:35]
So thank you.

Participant: [11:36]
I think it is very beneficial if we come out and we document, people get to know and in case of any lobbying, at least it is easier to see how the leadership can. Based on that, what we have whatever documented to see how they can lobby for funds.

Interviewer: [11:55]
Yeah.

Participant: [11:56]
And collaborations, probably.

Interviewer: [12:00]
Thank you. Thank you. So without giving me any leading information or identifying items, would you share with me any success story where you have seen a breakthrough with some of your clients who presented with a mental distress, but then after having therapy, life turned out around.

Participant: [12:23]
And Yeah, I would. Sensitive confidentiality. I think a successive story. It was one. It is always very, very much. In fact, there's a time I felt whenever I. I really hand a client, especially these soldiers of ours, because whenever they are in the mission area and we are hit, they always come for trauma risk assessment. And we see those who are probably affected and if they affected a debrief, we explain to them that this is a normal experience. It's a normal reaction to an abnormal situation that happened. And if we keep them around, we give them coping skills. And those who are. Who fail to go, probably we handle them in the mission area. When they go back, they feel the joy and they come back and said I was getting these nightmares I wasn't comfortable to share with my colleagues. I wasn't having good sleep, but now I'm getting good sleep. So it is a joy. And we see it is a little bit rewarding to us as, as clinicians that you are managing these guys in the mission areas. Otherwise it is always not good for them if they're affected like that. If they have these nightmares. It is even risky to deploy them both to our slaves and also to. To their colleagues. So the only alternative is to send them back to, to Uganda or out of the mission area. But if you manage them in the mission area and they get. They get back to their feet, they go back to the. To the operation and get better, it is rewarding to both to them and also to our slaves. So we feel, we feel great and proud when we handle these guys better. Although the challenges, as I. I told you, we are very few. And in most cases they deploy one or two in the mission area and you get overwhelmed because sometimes if they hit, they might hit like a. A battalion. Those are something like 500 soldiers handling them, screening them is a little bit hectic.

Interviewer: [14:32]
That will be very hectic.

Participant: [14:34]
Yeah. The workload is too big. By the time you come out with those who are really affected and how to handle them, it is too much. Then also the few resources you use first and foremost, as I told you that the manpower on the ground is limited. But also the resources you use it is instead because most cases you are in the operation area, it is a war zone. You don't have these resources available and you need to find a way of handling it. And also we still have issues of integrating ignore. Even outside that is the same integrating of these services psychotherapy into the normal streaming of health services with finding assistance. But I know with time it will. Otherwise they see the, the. The core of health services or the medical services. It seems as if whatever we're doing, it's not part of the health services or we are doing something totally different or maybe probably normal counseling. So I think with the time they know if we document, they will get to know also that at least whatever we are doing is a structured thing and it is evidence based so that they can come up and try to appreciate what you are doing and the good work we are doing that it is helping. It is helping a lot.

Interviewer: [15:56]
Thank you so much. Thank you so much. So you. Yeah. So we. We are going to still reflect on your experience as a clinical psychologist. Yeah. Yeah. So how has it helped you?

Participant: [16:14]
Okay. As a psychologist for sure, first and foremost it has helped me to develop my career in my career as a military psychologist in promotions and also deployments. It has helped me. And also there is a level of satisfaction if you handle someone and it gets better. There's that satisfaction. Then also it has helped a lot in sensitizing my other colleagues about mental health. Especially giving mental health services first aid from a risk management and also in bringing these other our bosses, the army readership on board to explain them how vital whatever the mental health services, the debrief, the the pre deployment kind of services or preparation is very very much important. So now it has been streamlined in whatever training we have before people go for the mission, we have to go and give that kind of services. We give the pre-deployment during the mission. We also give the induction and after the mission give the post deployment briefing. So it is kind of rewarding. And you see that that is some work done in the institution. And if it sometimes it minimizes the risk of seeing people shooting each other. Because nowadays it's not so much rampant like it used to be. So it gives you that satisfaction that whatever I'm doing at least has an impact in the community.

Interviewer: [18:07]
Thank you. Thank you. So moving on. So what are some of. What do you think are some of the biggest misconceptions about psychology in Uganda but more so in your area of practice because you have a special group you're dealing with. Yeah.

Participant: [18:26]
The misconception this side. I find that most people don't come up for this service just because they have that myth that it is for the mad people. I don't know if we have that outside there. In fact our side they use “atimwenazimo”. I don't know if you understand this is a swahili word meaning that this person is off, as in is not okay. That kind of conception they think that it is meant psychotherapy, the counseling. All that is all about for people who are not good. They say mad people. Yeah. So that one is really affecting the way people are really accessing the services. And the people will wait until they break down and that's when they are brought to us. Yet we try to tell you in case you see these symptoms, in case you think you don't sleep well, in case you you see visions, in case you do this and this, in case you get hallucinations. Please come early. The earlier the better. But they wait just because of the other stigma and conception that are people who go that side are not well. And also the other thing, they think that in case you are declared unfit, you are out of the marriage. Yeah, yeah. It is hard. So it is really affecting. It's a myth that whosoever comes that side is not. Is not fit. Is unfit for duty. So you find people don't come out very, very well or easily to come. And another myth, some of them, again, they go to the other extreme. They think that when you go there all things well, the way you see the medication works. So they come in the session thinking probably tomorrow will be better to explain that this one needs time, this one needs to. It's a process. You need to be cooperative. So it is a little bit challenging. But I think with time, if we can continue to sensitize people, such things can. We can handle them. We can address them.

Interviewer: [20:34]
Thank you. So on top of sensitization, which other ways do you think that you can be employed to address these misconceptions?

Participant: [20:49]
Obviously, we can't provide this service in isolation. If we cooperate with the normal health services. The way someone goes to see to seek services for malaria, probably as Maria parasites. The way someone goes to seek for HIV services. Let's be the same way. You normalize each and everything. Let us integrate the same normal health routines and people get to know. We normalize each and everything. They get to know it is. It is okay. And also in our trainings, the military trainings and probably outside their other trainings, let it be normal to train about mental health and how to seek about services. You go beyond to work in isolations. We incorporate to work with other health services. But the moment we isolate the moment they seek it, probably when someone is bad love, it's it. It continues to people. Continues to target to people who are mentally disturbed. Let us integrate it.

Interviewer: [21:55]
Thank you so much. Thank you so much. So I understand you’re operating with, amongst Ugandans and cultural factors are some of the attributes Ugandans we have. So how do you think culture factors influence the practice of. Of psychology in your area of operation?

Participant: [22:20]
As you say that the culture of Uganda, you know it very well. It is more because you know, look at the elders, religious leaders and all that. So as culture there is a way it affects people. Like they think that these services, all the service we give most cases it is. They let it to these other traditional. All the spiritual kind of beliefs, all the traditional healers. So by the time they come to us, they want us to operate in the same way. So if you don't you, you don't you don't you, you don't. You don't handle them and show them you give the psycho education very well. They might bound to make to mix their cultural issues with this other. And the challenging part of it. They, they first try out the other side. Which doctors or the, the, the category, those spiritual services, probably the priests, the, the, the, the witch doctors. When they feel that side, that's when they come to this other side, the medical side. And they don't come openly to psychologists for psychotherapy. They first go, they think probably it is a medical condition. That's when they identify that whatever treatment they have tried, the medical conditions, it has failed. That's when probably those clinicians send them to psychologists to handle the anxiety, to handle the depression and all that. But I think the culture, it is really affecting just because people, the way they take it to be the way they handle it in the other local way of handling it's the same way they think that it will be handled this way. So I'm thinking that we need to, if we continue to sensitize, I'm sure it is very much essential to, to seek this service early and the services available, it can be handled. Otherwise they mix it with this other culture of theirs. Then in the military, specifically the, the courage of the military, the command and control and, and the orders they give. And also in the, in the military they don't entertain being weak as the culture. You need to be strong, strong man. And sometimes they, they think that when I come out to seek for services, a weakling, I'm not good enough, I'm not fit enough. So because the character demands you to be strong woman, you don't fear, you. You are not supposed to. You are, you are strong man. You, you are not timid and all that. You, how can you break down? They see it as a weakness. So coming for the services, sometimes they think that they will be maybe tagged as someone who is weak. So we need to sensitize them that coming for the services seems a sign of weakness. You are just strong. You want to make, to be fit so that you can go back for your work. That's all.

Interviewer: [25:41]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. So, moving on. What do you think you had known before starting therapy? Especially we are focusing on your area. Yeah. So over the years, in the early years of your practice or even now, what do you wish you had known before starting practicing? Oh, maybe school could have missed it out or maybe exposure could have missed it out. Yeah.

Participant: [26:22]
I wish I knew probably that giving. Giving psychotherapy is something that thinking about it is something that is not a quick fix. Yeah yeah, it's not a quick fix. I would do  sensitize my other colleagues the same thing? Otherwise when you meet these other people, our clients, they think it is something that you are going to handle very fast. And the next day they go back forward because they keep on rushing you. When am I getting better? When are you qualifying me to go back for the mission? I wish I could. I could. I could put it into. And to them that please this is a process. You need to be very much cooperative. Then also how to handle stigma better. Because for sure sometimes even ourselves they stigmatize you. So you go there. You want to give a service. But there is a way they conv. They confuse you to be an investigator to be someone like an intelligence officer. So you're going as if you are investigating something. You find that the moment you go to, you are going to brief the colleagues on the parade. You are going to sensitize them about that, where you're going to handle the client, when they come in. Unless you do too much psycho education. Most of them when they come in before you start even a session they are suspecting. And in case whatever happened in the mission earlier on the in a traumatic event probably needs some court investigation. They try to drag you in those other lines thinking that you are part of them. You are going to give them the evidence. So I think I wish I could find a way of handling it better than just them probably telling me in those lines. Yes, that's it.

Interviewer: [28:38]
Thank you so much. So still continuing on that same area. So you’ve said that you have colleagues and more so you really wish. So how best do you think you can provide guidance for to your, to your other colleagues who participate in therapy so that you best guide your clients. Okay, sensitization. Which other avenues do you think can be used to help your colleagues to be able to deliver to their clients better.

Participant: [29:05]
So as I've said that they confuse you to be like an intelligence officer who is going to investigate. It is very very much important to assure. To assure confidentiality from the start. You tell them that whatever you are discussing here it is going to be kept confidential and it is. You give them the goal that the ultimate goal is to make you better. It is not an investigation. You need to be very also honest and trustworthy from the start as a therapist. Otherwise the moment you lose that they will go back and probably communicate to the rest and it will affect your career and also your profession. So from the start, you need to, you need to sensitize them. You need to assure them the confidentiality. You need to give them the goal of the, of the therapy you are giving all the service you are giving them. Try to tell them the limits of confidentiality that I will end here, I'll be here. Probably what I will, I will give out. It is this, this is a structured kind of therapy and it is the only, the only goal is to see that you get better. We handle this, we handle this and this, we handle youR sleeping disturbances so that by the time you in the session, they see what the goals and they see that they're getting better. And that's that one. I think it can work out, it can be a good strategy and it needs to come out from the start. Yes.

Interviewer: [30:38]
Yeah. Thank you so much. So you've. Yes, you, you've stressed more on confidentiality. But then there is always this assumption that operations in the army or in the military tend to be different. So my, my question would be with the same grounds of breaking of breaking of confidentiality still be the same grounds in the military in the light of order. How do you say order? What order? New order. Like once an order comes in, did you have the confidence of other therapists to hold confidentiality in areas where you should be able to oh, once an order comes in that it's an order, you don't have to question your superior because it is orders coming. So what are the standards like in the army?

Participant: [31:31]
When it comes to the professional world or the profession earlier in the military, they respect it like these other physical conditions. You can't bring your orders and you enter the theater and you do this because you're a commander. You can't just access medical records just because you're a commander. Yeah. They know their boundaries and it is very clear. So even this one, it is the same thing. To a certain extent we can release, a certain extent we can't. And these, the commanders, they know. Yeah. So when it comes that if you explain to them, you sensitize them that these bounds we can't go, they can do it very fast. And if it is in the professional line. Now that one goes beyond just being a military officer. According to my profession, I'm not supposed to do this, this and that and they respect that.

Interviewer: [32:27]
That's good to highlight. Yeah. So still continuing, what are some of the essential qualities that you think a therapist working in your setting should possess.

Participant: [32:39]
The qualities, first and foremost, as I said, confidentiality is key. To us, confidentiality. And that's how these soldiers will come out and they probably give you the information you need. Then being empathetic. From our training, it is also key from our training as in being a clinical psychologist, it is key. And also culturally you need to be aware, as we discuss earlier alone, that we have cultural issues. Yeah. Sensitivity, you need to be aware of those cultures you are operating in. And respect to us, it is, it is something which is, which is key. From the word go. Respect, it is really those qualities should come out very well. However much you’re in practice you need to respect. And in the military then flexibility, some issues, sometimes the places where you are you in the field, if you are so much conservative and you're like, ah, this must be there, then you wont practice. So flexibility, it is key to us. Another one. Communication skills, I think communication skills. Any therapist, to any therapist, the communication skills must come out, must be on your fingertips. Yeah. Then integrity. Yeah, integrity is also key. Yeah. Otherwise if you lose it, then you lose each and everything. Yes, I think that's all.

Interviewer: [34:21]
Thank you so much. Yeah. So we are, we are moving on to the culture aspect. I know we've been bringing it here and there. But then let's try to focus on each briefly and then we see what's coming out. So what culture differences between, how do you think cultural differences between you as a therapist and your clients can impact your therapeutic relationship?

Participant: [34:49]
Differences? Obviously I know that as a therapist, even in the military, people of different cultures, diverse kind of background. Even in Uganda they have different culture background and I think groups, different kind of religions, beliefs are totally different. And it can really affect the, the whatever the therapeutic relationship. If you are not sensitive, whatever, you are not sensitive to it. How? Just because the background is different. So you need to be aware and see how you bridge this. Because as I told you earlier alone, some of some, some of our clients, they believe that whatever you are doing is not totally different from the witch doctors, from the religious people, the priests. So if you don't handle it with care, if you're not open, open enough, it can affect the way you're handling it. So from the start you need to sensitize these clients you are doing. You need to know that they have different background. You need to, to know that they are of different ranks and the way you handle them, you handle them differently. Each client, you need to be, can I say client centered. Each client under that client differently. But it really affects the therapeutic relationship just because they come from different background. And some of them, they are from urban, others they are from rural areas. Others are probably the status, the economic status is totally different. Then when it comes to us, when it comes to the ranking, it's totally different. So you need to know those dynamics. So as a therapist, when you're offering you. You need to know also the language you are using to different elder, whatever personnel or different people. Yes, Hope, I've answered your question.

Interviewer: [37:02]
Yes, yes, yes, yes, you have. Yeah. So can you describe any cultural practice practices that have helped you cope with mental issues? Oh, that you've integrated into you…. Okay, may I sound… are you a Muganda, if I may?

Participant: [37:23]
Yeah. I'm Uganda. Yeah.

Interviewer: [37:26]
And what religion?

Participant: [37:29]
I'ma  born again.

Interviewer: [37:31]
Oh, okay. So now I'm going to see how these attributes of yours, could you be being a Muganda who could be a born again. How have these attributes of you been able to help you to do it to, to be better?

Participant: [37:53]
Okay, now first and forest. Being a born again, having that kind of faith that things can be better. It has really helped me in passing on the same communication to my clients until them that when you have faith, when you pray, you can cope better. You can alleviate this stress. And you find people normalizing in case they are tensed up, they go ahead, they pray and it is helping them.

Interviewer: [38:24]
Yeah.

Participant: [38:25]
Then they seek God. They seek the face of God. And tell them you instill hope in the. When you are living to the faith part of it. You try to instill hope, especially those who are depressed, things will be better and it helps them to normalize. And they use prayers as a coping mechanism. And then as. As a maganda, probably, you know, as baganda, we live as a. We are communal. We always get support from our colleagues. So it is the same way.

Interviewer: [38:58]
Yeah.

Participant: [38:58]
You tell them storytelling. You tell them that please in such moments you need your people more than any other. You need to stick together in case of anything, something you need to share with others. Your problem, a problem shared is halfway solved. You bring out those phrases so that you, you, you. You help these guys to seek social support from their colleagues. So as that cultural or that traditional practice of being together, togetherness, it helps them seek support from those others. Then also when it comes to group therapy, when you're giving these services, as in the group, you know, the. Our culture, we live in groups and also as the military we live in groups, we. We stay in battalions, baratoons and all that, so it helps a lot to ensure that at least, at least whatever service we give, we handle them in the group setting and they, they will quickly access the service just because we are in the groups and that kind of living together and being in the group. So when it comes to group therapy, it helps even better. So I would think when you, when you, you go in those lines of we are sharing, sharing experiences as peers, they will come up very quickly and use that to help the clients. And they, they do the sharing as group. They don't isolate themselves, they don't stay in isolation. They get to know that at least it is paramount to be sharing as a group. They don't live in isolation. So it normalizes the illness.

Interviewer: [40:46]
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. At one point you try to highlight about the myths and misconceptions about therapy and mental health. So which ones have you encountered and how have you worked around them?

Participant: [41:04]
Can I get that clear?

Interviewer: [41:07]
What are some of the common myths or misconceptions about therapy that you've encountered personally?

Participant: [41:15]
Oh, okay. The common myths are probably... I would, I would say when they come out for treatment, our clients in most cases they tag like, especially in our, in our military, they talk this. They look at these people as if they are possessed, especially people who have psychosis. They look at them as if they are possessed, as if they are. They are mad. And they are quick to say that that person is unfit, is not fit for deployment, and it is always affecting them, it is affecting their careers. So how to handle it? We try to see that at least we. We sensitize, we do psycho education to our commanders, to our groups, so that they get to know that whatever someone has happened, it is a normal reaction to an abnormal situation or event that really happened to them. So we try out to normalize each and everything. We say that please, someone is not possessed, it's not demon possessed, because at the moment, this is psychosis. It means that someone is mad. So they keep. When someone is in the community, in the community probably is even better. He got better. You find instead of giving an order that Vincent can do this, they say they as in you’re a mad person. So such kind of element, it doesn't come out very well. They tag you, they label you, whatever test they give you, just because one time you had psychosis. So I would think the more we. We come out and judgment and we sensitize people, we come up, tell our people, our bosses, our colleagues that please, someone is not possessed. It is just a normal reaction to an abnormal situation that happened one time. That's why he's behaving that way. And it is someone can get treatment and they get better. I think it is the way to go. Yeah.

Interviewer: [43:37]
Thank you so much. So you mentioned at one point you've experienced stigma as some mates also relate you to be an interrogator. You're still investigating. So how best did you handle it? How have you been able to handle their misconception about you? Like the kind of questions asking them. But then how have you been able to address those attitudes towards you which may point you to be as an interrogator yet you’re a therapist. Have you been able to address that stigma?

Participant: [44:11]
One I'd already shared is about psycho education and two, stigma from the point of therapy as you are starting, this one must come out very clear. You need to talk to these people that please, you need to distance yourself from the other people. Otherwise if even the way they come into your counseling room or your psychotherapy room is escorted. Sometimes they're also on offerings. So you need to say that please this is a treatment center. This is a treatment room. You don't need this and this. If you are really protecting this person, you are guarding this person should not escape. Please give a distance. Let me handle this other part. So you need to create a safe room, a safe environment for this clan so that they can see a distinction from whatever they are. Because sometimes they are coming from prison, they have brought them for a service they want to ascertain. So you need to distance yourself. You need to to tell this person, please release this person. You can't probably form a distance. Then you enter into a room and you handle the client. Then from that you need to ensure confidentiality in whatever you are and you know the limit of how you are going to ask to give out the information. And then you need to be non judgmental as much as possible so that you can create trust with this other with your client. So think that one it can create at least trust in in this person and may not stigmatize you. And also for these others, probably others that are left behind, you just need to do psycho education and tell them that ah, this is total therapy. Psychotherapy is all about this. And to ensure that you get better, you get back to your feet and go back to the battlefield when you are fit to fight without this kind seeing some visual hallucinations, probably getting auditorly hallucinations, getting other commands outside the commands of your commander. If you come out and sensitize and tell them what it's all about the, the therapy and how it is going to benefit them. Not only them and also the relatives, the debrief, you tell them all about that they get to know and they pick and say oh, this is for our own benefit. This is all about how we can get better. And we go back to see our relatives and they probably go for mission when we are fit mentally and physically. Like the way they do the physical tests to ensure that you are deployable. It is the same way we do the psychological services to ensure that you are deployed when you are fit mentally. That's all.

Interviewer: [47:09]
Thank you so much. Yeah. So. So what do you think is the most important thing that people should understand about mental health or therapy more so in your area of operation? Okay, now you've been trying to, by now just to be specific on a point.

Participant: [47:32]
I think the most important thing of mental health care is all psychotherapy. It's not. It's not something that it is for the mad people the way they say. The people who are unfit people should come out and get to know that this is the services which is offered to ensure that people get better and they are fit for whatever task they are supposed to be sent for. And also it is not so much different from the physical care they give the way someone seeks for. Probably if they have a tooth, a toothache or probably they. They have some other upsets or pain somewhere. It is. This is also the way they probably have a physical wound. This is a. An invisible wound which you can see that needs. And also the way you handle it should be the same way. It's not totally different. The way they see the physical wounds is a way you come and access services and it is treated in the same way. It's not totally different. Yeah, even in the way the other one is structured also this one is structured. It is not totally different from what use the other services. And it is evidence based. It is not something like the way they see the prayers work, the way you see which doctors work. No, this is totally different. It's not different from what the physical kind of care. It is and people should access it the way they access it this other physical care. But the only tricky part of it, the physical care, they first feel the pain. And here sometimes you. You need to. Someone needs to tell you that probably you. You're not okay, you're abnormal in some way. You need to go for research. So I would think people need to come out of the way they perceive our services is not. And also as I shared earlier on it is not kind of someone is investigating that. It's going to. But it is going to be consequential. Probably they will say that you are not fit for, for deployment. You need to go back home, you need, you are good for retirement. You know, our. Can I say our duty. You can't discard someone who is mentally disturbed. It can be related to you, to, to the colleagues and also to, to the entire community. Yeah. So in those lines we need, we need to come out very clear that whatever service we do is to make them better so that they don't go and harm the community and the colleagues. Yes.

Interviewer: [50:34]
Thank you so much. So have you ever, can you describe a particular. Have you ever experienced therapy as a person? Have you ever received therapy in any form of therapy or guidance during the training?

Participant: [50:52]
During the training, we practice on each other, but in person not yet. Not yet.

Interviewer: [51:05]
Okay. So thank you. If you're to remember what made it helpful, what made it helpful for you, was it like, is it a memorable experience that you felt like it's good for therapists to also experience something. So I think… how was the experience like?

Participant: [51:27]
Oh, yeah, probably one time, we met as colleagues and we were in the operation and we like, we have worked hard. In fact, it was something like in three weeks of intense after being hit. And then we said that, you know, they always talk about vicarious trauma. We might break down here, we might break down. If we break down, how, who will handle these others in this mission? So we sat down as a team of mental, mental health with those PCOs and also the social workers. And we are managing ourselves as an awesome. Trying to give coping skills, trying to talk to each other. And I found it was helpful giving relaxation techniques as a group. It was a group session. Yeah, yeah. Giving relaxation techniques that breathe in, breathe out. But you could tell a difference later on. Then later on we could say that can we go out for exercises as a group, a mental health group. And it took time. Like every evening would run, they stretch and come back and it was really working. And that moment, those who are taking alcohol, we are telling them, but please don't, don't. And I found I myself it was really working those kind of laxation techniques. And they also the. The exercises in the evening reminding each other, please call home, hear from your wife, keep in touch. Those things were really helping. Although you may not get the immediate one, but you could see that at least you get that resilience can push better, you can manage others. Otherwise the moment you break down the team which is supposed to manage others. That's when things would go astray. But I found it helpful.

Interviewer: [53:33]
Yeah, thank you so much.

Participant: [53:38]
Also listening. That element of getting someone to listen to or to talk to, it was really helpful because we, we always talk to others. But later, alone, I had someone to, to talk to me and I was listening. So I find it was helpful. I didn't know that getting someone to talk to. Some of us, we may not have people, especially in the military. Most cases we don't ask anyone to listen to you because get orders, you move. Get orders, you gather up. But I found that experience, getting someone to listen to my issue, my problems, what I'm going through, it is very rewarding. And there's a way it puts you to another level. Otherwise, in our setting, we don't normally get people to, to listen to us. You are supposed to pick orders and move. But getting someone to listen to you, you explain, you ask questions, you do this and that, it was really rewarding to me and I found it was helpful.

Interviewer: [54:42]
Thank you so much. That's good to. To know. So we've come to the end of our discussion. I appreciate the time you really took off. Thank you so much. But just in case there is anything you wouldn't want us to. You'd want us to emphasize on in a guidebook. What would be that one thing? (Oh) Besides sensitization and integration of mental health in the other packages of health management, is there anything else that you would, you would want to emphasize on that we shouldn't leave out?

Participant: [55:19]
Yeah. So something I will need to emphasize, so I would read about psychotherapy. This one goes to the other medical services they provide in this country, we should not handle us in isolation. They should not see us as if we, what we are doing is totally different from. It is not part of the health services we're given in this country. And I think that's what has even delayed the, the licensing and all these other places to ensure that we register with allied health. It is a healthy service like in other parts of the world. In Uganda, we still have issues on this. And also when it comes to remunerations and payments of our allowances and salaries, you find they always target us and they don't understand it. We find that it's not part of a science that is a core in this country, but it provides someone. It's a service that is supposed to be provided to in the health setting. They look at it, you know, as if it is something like the priests do the kind of counseling. They look at it as if it's no different like these other normal counseling people or do probably in case they have issues in the family. So I would. I'd wish that one to come out very clearly that whatever we are offering, it is a kind of structured and evidence based and it is a process that made someone get better here. And most cases they… what faces the other side of the medical part, the physical world, if we handle it this way, because people go there. They. They have inner wounds that cannot be seen, which I. And they call. They go. They complain about the headache, they complain about physical pain, they complain about lack of sleep. And the problem. These other physicians, the problem, the clinicians, the clinic officers, the doctors cannot really see that this is is a psychological problem that will need psychological help. And they see us as if we are not part of them to give the service. We won't have a comprehensive kind of air. So we need to be part of them. We need to work with them to ensure that at least we see our clients in a comprehensive way. And we do, in a multi kind of disciplinary approach. Yeah, I think that is all I can add on/

Interviewer: [58:03]
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you so much. I have to wish you a good day. We really do appreciate.

Participant: [58:14]
Thank you too for the time you have given me and also the chance you have given me to share with you, and from my experience...

Interviewer: [58:22]
And thanks for your service. Thank you for the services you render to this country. We appreciate.

Participant: [58:31]
You’re welcome. And I know we shall keep the confidentiality we talked about and the limits we agreed as I'm providing the services. Definitely whatever the…(inaudible) Okay. Thank you. Have a good day.

Interviewer: [58:52]
All right. Blessings.
