I am fair. Now at least I can give you attention.
 
Speaker B: [00:31]
Oh, that's promising. Sorry. Sorry about whatever was happening by the fact that you're fair. That's promising.
 
Speaker A: [00:41]
I'm. I'm nursing my dad and that time he was critically ill, really. And I was. Wasn't settled in one place.
 
Speaker B: [00:52]
Oh, you can imagine. Hope he's in a better state.
 
Speaker A: [00:56]

I'm sorry for the loss of Roscoe's mother.
 
Speaker B: [01:07]
Yeah. It's such a pity. It was such a pity. Yeah. Such a pity. Something which disorganized us somehow. Yeah. But yeah. Let's start the sad realities of life.
 
Speaker A: [01:23]
Yeah.
 
Speaker B: [01:25]
Yeah.
 
Speaker A: [01:26]
I hope you both went through it and you're strong now.
 
Speaker B: [01:33]

Speaker A: [01:38]
That's. Yes.
 
Speaker B: [01:40]
Yeah.
 
Speaker A: [01:41]
It's possible to remain with some strength to carry on.
 
Speaker B: [01:46]
Yeah. Actually, we thought whether we'd put things on her, but they're like, no. If he was strong enough to keep things moving. And that gave me strength. Everything. Yeah. But yeah, I think it's growing up. Yeah. Growing up, you come to these realities for them the best way. But it's when you grow up and.
 
Speaker A: [02:09]
It's something you get used to.
 
Speaker B: [02:12]
You can't. You can't buy something you expect and like that's a reality. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So how is work?
 
Speaker A: [02:23]
Work is fair.
 
Speaker B: [02:25]
Oh, that's good to know. That's good to know. That's good to know. Yeah. I wonder whether you had an opportunity to look at that discussion points.
 
Speaker A: [02:35]
I did,  I’d still go through them.
 
Speaker B: [02:41]
Yeah, definitely.
 
Speaker A: [02:43]
Will I be checking on my phone, like for the questions? Okay. The other guide or you will be asking me?
 
Speaker B: [02:51]
I'm going to direct you from this side. However, if you made any notes, feel free to cross check with them because sometimes we share so that people may not forget at the same time be able to prepare what they feel like. Shouldn't be left out.
 
Speaker A: [03:07]
No, it's only one thing that I wrote down not to forget.
 
Speaker B: [03:13]
Okay. No worries. No worries.
 
Speaker A: [03:16]
I wanted it to be free. Like an interaction.
 
Speaker B: [03:19]
I understand. I understand. Yeah. So let's dive in. I would like to hear how your background has been in therapy, the years of practice, the training and where you. The settings in which you get involved in.
 
Speaker A: [03:37]
Does that involve my education background and work experience?
 
Speaker B: [03:42]
Yeah. More of education like where did you train from? And then also. Yeah. Coming to the…
 
Speaker A: [03:49]
My journey. My journey to counseling psychology. (Okay) Started as. It wasn't my choice.
 
Speaker B: [04:01]
Okay.
 
Speaker A: [04:02]
At bachelor's level.
 
Speaker B: [04:06]
Okay.
 
Speaker A: [04:06]
Because I was so naive, like in a level about counseling and psychology and what. But it was a course, I would say given to me.
 
Speaker B: [04:19]
Okay.
 
Speaker A: [04:21]
Because I'm sure they had wanted to. It was still not many were offering it by choice. So they would like, I think, give it to people who they choose to give it. I don't know how, but I think it is God also in the end, because it wasn't at all in my choices. But then I was given to. At Kyambogo University.
 
Speaker B: [04:56]
Okay.
 
Speaker A: [04:57]
And I was given to eat. Okay. No, no, no. My family then chose that I go to Kyambogo because we had been given a similar course with my brother and we were in the same year at Makerere University.
 
Speaker B: [05:10]
Okay.
 
Speaker A: [05:11]
So they decided that we can't do the same. Therefore I go there. Since me, I had two options. So that is how I started. So at bachelor's level, I really did it to pass, to get. To get that paper. And because my parents wanted to see me complete. Yeah. So I won't say that I really enjoyed bachelors. Yeah.
 
Speaker B: [05:44]
That means that you did a bachelor's in counseling.
 
Speaker A: [05:47]
I did a bachelor's in guidance and counseling.
 
Speaker B: [05:50]
Okay.
 
Speaker A: [05:51]
At Kyambogo University. And now it was towards the end of it when we started doing practicum because we would do it in second year and third year. So the practice I did in second year was with hiv. HIV counseling. And I liked how I interacted with people. For me, I went beyond just results and HIV. And I took interest, personal interest in also knowing especially the. The individuals who used to come as a couple. Yes, those are the ones. So that is how I started picking interest in like discussing issues that are just beyond what has brought the person for to the clinic. So that was even the second training I did in third year was also in HIV counseling. And that is when now I can say my passion for counseling started.
 
Speaker B: [07:01]
Okay.
 
Speaker A: [07:03]
And that is how I. I picked interest in wanting to now do a postgraduate masters. And I did counseling psychology from Uganda Martyrs University.
 
Speaker B: [07:19]
Okay.
 
Speaker A: [07:22]
And while there I met this very intelligent man called Dr. Fr Pascal Kabuura who was the main trainer. And I really liked how he, he trained with the knowledge of the context of, of Africa and specifically Uganda. So his lectures were very interesting and made me love psychology and counseling. So my passion now was when I was doing that course, the postgraduate masters in counseling psychology. And during, during, during the, during the course which was for two years we would of course be required to be practicing because those hours contributed to, to, to max to scores. Yeah. And there it was general really. It was family issues, it was adolescent, it was a relationship, it was wide. Any issue, any person, any client who would come to the center for counseling, they would refer to me and others. So it wasn't like some area of specification. And since I was studying, I, Yeah, I interacted with almost many, many challenges. Yeah. And with that after, after the master's course is when now I, I started real practice as an employee with people affected by conflict. And those are refugees where the common, the common problem they had was trauma, depression and. Yeah. Other issues. Substance related issues. Yeah. And this was in Kyangwali. Kyangwali refugee settlement. So from, from. I don't remember the year, but it is now like for, for 10 years I have been working with, with, with that category of people, people displaced by conflicts, by war, where the most common thing is trauma and then the other related disorders that come with that.
 
Speaker B: [10:12]
Okay.
 
Speaker A: [10:14]
But in between there I also had about two years working with people, people who have substance use disorders in one of the, the private rehabilitation centers in Kampala. And that was also like a very, very rich background for me to get exposed to many other mental disorders because substance use would also induce many other disorders. True or stressors. And that really gave me, gave me a chance to learn because we were a team of. We had psychiatric doctors and nurses and psychologists and psychosocial workers. So I really learned a lot from them in regards to different mental disorders, apart from the main thing that the center was dealing with, which was substance use disorders.
 
Speaker B: [11:26]
Yeah.
 
Speaker A: [11:27]
I think that is briefly what I have done so in, in all these fields. Substance use and then trauma. I meet all categories of people. Children, young adults, adolescents, elderly and, and the modality of counseling ranges from individual counseling to group counseling to family. Yeah. So it is wide. It is not just seeing the person who is affected, but also the other people involved in this person's life.
 
Speaker B: [12:11]
Okay, that's really nice. Thank you so much for giving me such a rich, a rich background. Yeah. So what has surprised you for all these, for the, for the past 10 years? What has been surprising or challenging since you started practicing counseling?
 
Speaker A: [12:30]
The most challenging thing I have found in all these different individuals. Okay. To start with, the most interesting has been that you will have people who have gone through the same experience. But the way they are affected and the way they interpret it and how they cope with it is totally different. Like every individual is new and that's what makes me enjoy this work. Like as much as I'm in the same field. Every individual is totally different from the one you saw yesterday. And therefore you deal with them different. It's always a new experience. That one was in theory, but it is one thing that I have found in. In. In reality, which is so interesting. That's one. And then the second. Now which has. Did you say the one that has surprised me? Surprised. Okay. Challenged. The biggest challenge I have fixed and I think this is. This is partly because counseling and psychology are not so embraced in Uganda. Is how families are inter described as the cause of the issue. And this is usually witchcraft. Witchcraft or maybe cursed. Cursed by God. Now the curse. The curse. That one I met much with. With people who are displaced by war who would think maybe they are going through what they are going because God is angry them and so he's like punishing. That would be a few. Then there are those who would describe it as relating it to the story of. Are they Israelites who were moving from Egypt to Canaan? Something like that. Like, so they related to this is a phase which has been placed by God which is leading us to the promised land. And that would be their source of hope. I found it so interesting. Like they would persist and endure in their suffering as a. As a way of coping and it would help them. Surprise. I really found that interesting. Like how someone can live by. By that belief and they endure all the suffering because they know it was predetermined and it is leading them to the canon land. That was interesting. And then another one which I find very common is the witchcraft. Like how families describe the cause of the illness of their family member is because they are bewitched by. Sometimes they know who and sometimes they don't know. And now this was. Okay. That was surprising and challenging because then the interventions of counseling would. Would not be. They wouldn't cooperate so well. And then they resort to either traditional approaches of what we call witch doctors or to pastors and religious leaders, depending on their religious affiliation. But they would still go there and it doesn't work and then come back for treatment. So for those who got healed, especially those who had mental disorders that required medication for those who saw progress now believe that it is really a mental disorder and that it exists. It's not a white man's thing. But then there are those who get stuck in and the person only gets worse. And then I am watching, but I can't do anything because. Because of what they believe in. I really find it a challenge. Yeah.
 
Speaker B: [17:31]
Thank you.
 
Speaker A: [17:33]
You're welcome.
 
Speaker B: [17:38]
So do you recall an interaction or session that deeply moved you, unsettled you? Without giving me any leading details on that, That one empowered, that one particular session which left you. Yeah. Disturbed. I'm deeply moved. You're like, okay.
 
Speaker A: [18:11]
I'm trying. Yes, I have. And this is like I was in a session once where I really felt pity, sad because of the client's. Client's situation. Like, this client really was alone. Alone, like, in the world. So she didn't know any, any of her relatives when there was this fleeing, when they were fleeing. She fled with people who she didn't know. I think they were like neighbors or in the same community, but she really didn't know them. So they, like, got, they got. What's the appropriate word? I have forgotten. But, like, she wasn't able to flee with her close blood family members. So everyone was displaced in different directions and they never met, I think, up to now. So she was really disturbed. And this disturbed me as well because I felt stuck. I only imagined how it feels being now in another country as a refugee. But you're growing up in a family which you know is not yours blood, and then you have no trace or idea of where your parents fled to or whether they are still alive or dead, plus siblings. And, like, you have no hope. It really disturbed me. And yeah, I really felt pain for this client. Because it is beyond just feeling alone. But they are really alone.
 
Speaker B: [20:20]
I can imagine.
 
Speaker A: [20:23]
Yeah.
 
Speaker B: [20:24]
Yeah. So, okay, so how do you best cope when you find yourself in such situations?
 
Speaker A: [20:32]
I, I have a counselor. I have a professional counselor, but then I also have a peer, a peer counselor who is a friend.
 
Speaker B: [20:43]
Okay.
 
Speaker A: [20:44]
Who I usually talk to. The professional one is once in a while. But then this peer counselor is almost every three days or every weekend at least. We talk about a lot of things and it helps, it helps me get off the, the, the, the confusion and too many things which I hold in my head. But at my current workplace, we also have, we have, we have a supervisor.
 
Speaker B: [21:23]
Okay.
 
Speaker A: [21:25]
Yeah. Professional supervisor who, like, we meet monthly for supervision. And that alone helps, helps in building my competence, but also in knowing how, how to keep myself detached. And then away from talking away from talking. I have learned coping skills like which I get involved in activities I like I love music so much so every evening that is one thing I do to debrief and then I don't carry work home and I like socializing more so with family members. So those are also the things I do personally which help me in the end like for my mind not to always think of work, work, work and then holding this client's issue throughout the night and day.
 
Speaker B: [22:46]
Okay. Thank you. So we will, we had earlier talked about had earlier talked about. You earlier talked about the culture and myth and beliefs associated in therapy. As you're sharing what has surprised or challenged you then I would ask you how best have you been able to address these beliefs without alienating their or dismissing their worldly view.
 
Speaker A: [23:32]
How I have been able to is to yeah acknowledge that they are their beliefs are their beliefs and that what you believe contributes a lot to your healing process. So like by normalizing their beliefs without approving or disapproving them like has helped me not not be judgmental and it makes the client free. And how do I know this it is by those who have managed to come back saying it has not worked. Let's try out this or being open on what next they are going to do either to see a traditional healer or if they've seen them before. They are those who give me the modalities they have tried out. And by the time someone tells you they have visited a shrine or done certain rituals and what I really feel it is from how I I don't judge. I normalize their beliefs and practices and leave it up to them to try out because that's the only way they will appreciate the modality that will work other than me trying to also sell to them my idea. And then again how I manage how I how I have managed to to swing along is by knowing that I can't. I can't be knowing the causes of all the people's issues. They know their families and themselves better and yeah you never know. So that open minded I have has really helped me not to be judgmental.
 
Speaker B: [25:41]
Okay.
 
Speaker A: [25:42]
And to yeah if it's your belief it's okay. We can share about it even if it's not mine. Try it out. Try things as long as there is no risk to life involved try because the goal is to to get healing.
 
Speaker B: [26:03]
Thank you.
 
Speaker A: [26:03]
Through this through this also with when I was with those of substance use disorders they are those who finally like they went through the center rehabilitated but then someone relapses but because they keep in touch, they later tell you, oh, we went to some church or we did this, and the person is now okay. Yeah. So like, it is. I respect that. It is our beliefs and practices that sometimes have a big influence in healing. And because psychologically, like, if you believe in something, you'll also put in effort. And you never know the effort you're putting in because of maybe what pastor X or traditional healer X has said are indirectly interventions that you need to actually keep yourself away from triggers.
 
Speaker B: [27:19]
Okay. You there?
 
Speaker A: [27:37]
Yes, I'm there.
 
Speaker B: [27:38]
Awesome. Yeah. So have you encountered any metaphors or local expressions or proverbs that clans commonly describe used to describe their psychological distresses?
 
Speaker A: [27:53]
Yeah, and that's the question I wrote down. Not to forget the most common. You said metaphor what… I want to use the word.
 
Speaker B: [28:04]
Could be local expressions or proverbs.
 
Speaker A: [28:08]
The local expression I have had most is “this is the sacrifice of the family”. Do you know what that means?
 
Speaker B: [28:20]
I'm trying to process it.
 
Speaker A: [28:23]
So what it means is like in many families, if not all, there is always that person who is like…
 
Speaker B: [28:36]
Is like the cursed one of the family.
 
Speaker A: [28:39]
A what?
 
Speaker B: [28:41]
I don't know. Would it be the cursed one in the family?
 
Speaker A: [28:43]
Huh? The cursed one, but like cursed for the good of others. Like, it is because of that person that probably the others are thriving and prospering because this is the sacrifice that was given for the good of the family. That is what I have heard most. So like, they have accepted and left the person to be like that because they are like the family's sacrificial lamb. So there are those who. Who like with the education that we give the psycho education and awareness, that belief blocks them from taking in the knowledge. That is the biggest I have met.
 
Speaker B: [29:51]
Thank you so much for sharing that. So we shall move on to the ethical dilemmas and boundary issues. Given your years of practice, have you experienced any ethical dilemmas?
 
Speaker A: [30:08]
Oh, yeah. Ethical dilemmas. I have encountered several because that is we are human beings and then we are Ugandans, where sometimes. Sometimes the issue of boundaries really sounds so western. If you put it practice like, so someone will expect. Because we have had a session, they can now we can be friends. So I have had a problem of remaining professional for almost all my clients because all of them now start. Can I visit you? Can I do what can we then like the. The calls if they have. If they've taken my contact. The calls I could. I just called check on you. How are you? And then there is one now who it is now that I'm realizing that the… Yeah, this one I think I have really failed to. To. To remain professional. Like to maintain the professional relationship. We met because now she's someone I even sometimes tell my personal problems. And then she's the one comforting me.
 
Speaker B: [31:44]
Oh.
 
Speaker A: [31:47]
And this was a client I met in 20. Was it around 2017? Yeah. So that. That is the biggest like on that. If we meet and talk. First of all the talking in our context here, the counseling is looked at as like. I mean, how do you talk? And then you claim you've helped me. It is therapy like that way that one is. We are really struggling for people to understand that. So the temptation of becoming friends with clients is really high. Or even the temptation of like luring me into deals that involve money or maybe into their business or what becoming a business partner or etc is really difficult. And then being a lady, even the advances. I saw that question here. I hope I can also talk about it like. So the. The advances from the main clients. And then the problem comes when they are like a couple. And then the husband starts like making comparisons with the counselor they met in a session with their wives. And then it becomes like a problem now with their wife. I have encountered that with one couple. But it was really disturbing how I seemed now to be. To be a rival of the woman. Because the man started making comparisons.
 
Speaker B: [33:44]
Comparisons?
 
Speaker A: [33:45]
Yes. The calmness. The one you've not met me, but many people say I'm calm. And this is what now the woman, the man wanted his wife to.
 
Speaker B: [33:58]
To exercise.
 
Speaker A: [34:01]
Yes. And that became a problem.
 
Speaker B: [34:10]
I see.
 
Speaker A: [34:12]
Yeah.
 
Speaker B: [34:14]
Thank you for sharing that here you've already highlighted. I want a bit of. So how do you manage these boundaries now? Like I understand you have struggles of separating the attachments to clients. Some have been clients, but now they seem to be like friends. But at the same time the African within you values relationships and would want to handle them in this way you attached. It's not a bit of a termination. Once business is done, then you like. You just can't leave them like orphans. They always attach to them. So how are you managing to create these boundaries amidst.
 
Speaker A: [34:57]
How I have managed. It is also how the. The working policies have helped me a lot. So like it is easier to make these communications and clearly make it known to the client that we are only meeting for work. So somehow that has helped me that when we end the relationship. And this is mainly for when I was with the. The refugees. When we ended those ones we ended and by chance for them like phones. Phones are a luxury. So most of them don't have. So the physical, physical separation with them helped me detach naturally. But my biggest problem was with these people with substance use disorders where the client, the client feels like you're the only person who has understood them in their whole family. And so they will also always tell their families, even when they've been discharged, how white is the other one? Me, I want to talk to the other one. You people don't understand what. And then it would keep the relationship on whether they have relapsed or not. But somehow I would refer back like if it is me still coming to follow up, it has to come through the organization, not me doing it personally. And sometimes that would involve a higher cost to the family. So somehow they would, they would drop that idea and then stop like reduce on expecting me to continue with them personally. So that somehow helped which is like the work, the employment policies. But then over time it is something I learned over time that as the numbers grow of my clients and it is me who gets involved if I don't intentionally detach and end those relationships when, when our sessions are done. Yeah, okay. But it's really the African in me.
 
Speaker B: [37:24]
I understand sometimes the heart of where.
 
Speaker A: [37:29]
That also the heart of the therapist. But then even the people like you can't tell them I can't call you any time. I mean how.
 
Speaker B: [37:40]
I know.
 
Speaker A: [37:43]
Yeah. With that I said like my own principles, like my phone is not available beyond 9pm and then yeah, you know and you know if someone like consistently calls and maybe you're not picking or what they eventually drop off. Yeah.
 
Speaker B: [38:08]
Okay. So now that you're highlighting the bits of sometimes for example, I would say the termination thing might come off as being insensitive when you say that you only agreed to eight sessions. Eight sessions are done. So we've come to the end of our session. But then when you know that definitely by default you are likely to have another encounter. When you. If they present like the either substance abuse, you know how they present like this is the only client, the only therapist would really work for me. And from nowhere they could be going through a crisis. But then your terms of engagement were like ah, professional and everything. I have to first go to the institution and everything. Then payment and all that. And then like client this, this bits of. These bits of agreements with institutions we are working with. You're dealing with a client personally. But then they have to go to the institution could be a crisis. So have you come across any gray areas?
 
Speaker A: [39:13]
Gray areas. Make that clearer.
 
Speaker B: [39:14]
Gray areas. When you, you while dealing with decisions or While working with clients and. Or while working with these ethical and boundary issues area. That's why you feel like these ones need to be more discussed.
 
Speaker A: [39:29]
With the client or with the organization.
 
Speaker B: [39:33]
With us. Okay. With us and how we handle therapy. You feel like, ah, this is ethical. Yes. But when you get to think about it like it may not be so practical. How best can we make it? Like, how, how best would we like, like handle it? Because if you told me that I.
 
Speaker A: [39:51]
Have to terminate for some for someone now, this is what is practical. It requires some flexibility. Flexibility of. If I can give for example, maybe a referral or maybe just one statement or a discussion over the phone that can empower a family member to handle that one I can do even if it is one year after station because like it's almost a crisis or something has happened and someone is probably stuck just because of the. At that moment. They can't. They don't remember that I need to do this. In this case, that's what I usually do. So it calls for some. For flexibility in our context where sometimes even people the money and what is a long process. So that I really do. And that is one reason why for some clients up to now still like they will call or meet me and we talk without any costs involved. Yeah. So those are also there who I can say I have. I. I've not ended. Yeah. So it requires some flexibility. And also now knowing several partners where. Because it is referrals that have helped me. For example, like I say, okay, now I'm unable to help, but can I refer you to someone else? Yes. Or probably remind them of something that will empower them to handle the situation? Yeah, that one I do over the phone.
 
Speaker B: [41:42]
Okay, thank you. And now we are looking back. You're doing reflections and recommendation looking back to your years of training, both at undergrad by the same time at Masters and the trainings you had over time. What do you wish you had been told during your training that was mis. At one point missed out, but you feel like you wish.
 
Speaker A: [42:11]
I wish I was told okay. At undergraduate, at undergraduate I wasn't told. But at graduate, at the graduate course I was told because this professor was very, very local. He studied in the US but he really managed to. To localize or contextualize all the concepts locally. So he would use most examples locally and it really helps you understand. So what I wish I was told, for example at undergraduate, is that some of these, some of these concepts in psychology, in what written in English.
 
Speaker B: [43:01]
But.
 
Speaker A: [43:02]
We, we are, we already have them. In local terms. And if you can describe them locally, your trainees understand better which even becomes easier for them at practice. Because I have met up to now. Yes, I use the DSM5 and all those terms that we learned in Western like the researches and what we are done not in Africa, but like I'm really, I really go slow on describing using those terms more so when I am creating awareness to this person. I also try as much as possible to use examples we've have, we've had for long and how they are a problem of the mind and the brain. Sure, yeah, that is what I wish. I wish our lessons are contextualized to Africa. And also I wish, I wish I was told that yeah, we are learning generally, but you take every client totally different from another who have similar everything but treat them different. And that, that has improved my listening skills and patience and learning. Learning from a person about their life because I mean it's their life. Yeah, that I wish was emphasized that you, yes, you are a counselor, you have learned, but the person is the master of their lives and you need to learn from them to help them better. Not bringing what you, you have been taught in all those theories and whatever researches that were done on other people who even had different cultures and listen to this one. But use that knowledge that you have learned to locally help someone in their lives. Work, actually work with each other to find a solution for this person. I wish that was really emphasized, but it is for me. It was done in passing.
 
Speaker B: [45:59]
Thank you. So now that you're talking about contextualization and all that, what strength do you think Ugandan therapists bring that might seem to be underappreciated in globally?
 
Speaker A: [46:16]
I think try trying to interpret, trying to interpret psychology that was researched and proved in another, in a culture which is totally different from ours, but trying the Ugandan therapist trying as much as possible to make them local or explain them as simple as possible or apply these techniques which are sometimes, sometimes for example, we've talked about boundaries that is really not African. But for, for Ugandan therapists who try to accommodate and then teach and then learn and unlearn all these things in this context, it is a very big strength, very big strength in a way that, you know, most of the things, most of the learnings we have in Uganda would be much better if they were say, locally designed and implemented. So therapist Bambi, we are trying so much to do that and I don't know how far we've gone, but it's a strength like where I have to because most of the counseling I do, the clients I have seen are illiterate and so illiterate. I mean they have no education, so they didn't even. They don't know English for most of them. So you can imagine having to translate all these terms and the knowledge I learned in English to the local language. I find that so powerful.
 
Speaker B: [48:18]
Yeah. Well, that is really something. Yeah. So in your opinion, what do you feel like. Shouldn't be left out if we're to put up a guidebook for therapists working in Uganda. What are those things we should do be maybe on their fingertips.
 
Speaker A: [48:54]
Yeah. The. The one I said I wished I knew that. Let the client. Let the client. Okay. Learn, Learn. First learn. Each clients you have their experiences, their life, their word. Like we need to first learn them and that is by listening. And then you can design your interventions and support after learning them because they are totally different. Yeah. And these cuts across. You can't say this skill for couples is what I'll always use. And then you have like a guide. When I have a couple session, this is what I go through. No, no, no. For me, I would want to first learn that couple. And. And in that case they are also learning each other because that's something which is also not African. We just to enter relationships and marriages when we don't know each other. So even when they come to counseling, the two actually don't know themselves. So bringing in the. A laid out. A laid out structure of how I will deal with couples because I was told generally how to deal the basics for couples would be wrong because then all of us will be ignorant of. The couple will be ignorant of themselves as individuals and the cancer will also be ignorant of that. What. What are you actually dealing with? For me, that would be the first really thing like let. We need sessions to first learn this person and know what will be appropriate for them. Then the second one is around tools the psychological tools we use to assess. I don't know. I don't know whether I'll be very clear. But over time I'm also finding them just a guide in. In my work. Why? Because our culture, our African culture is not a very open one that when you really ask me whether I have nightmares, I even I. First of all I can't categorize or describe what nightmares are. So the response I'm going to get from this person is in most cases not an accurate one because one of ignorance of like certain things. But also as African we are not as accurate as the people who developed these tools. So to me. To me they are like guides. Like you know, the principles of these tools is that you don't alter or change or try to describe a question. But for me I have find that not applicable because. Because of our culture of not being accurate like in answering questions, our African culture is not accurate. You will ask me, do you cry often? And because the answer should be according to the ones who design should be a yes or no. I will say yes because I cried often today. Today. So like the word often is not African, but because you're asking it and may sometimes translation can make it get lost. You still have to describe what you mean to get an accurate answer.
 
Speaker B: [53:12]
True.
 
Speaker A: [53:13]
So I have found myself in most cases administering these tools. But the ones where I. And I'm sorry it is being recorded I am doing the wrong thing where I. I try to explain and let the also the client ask to make sure they've understood. Yes, I have got. But to the ones who develop they don't want that. They want you to ask. Ask directly. And the response they give is that one I have found myself getting more accurate answers. Okay, scores to this one. Where is a tool which is maybe said to last 20 minutes for a daylight person lasts like an hour to the other one because we have gone question by question and discussing what exactly it is. Yeah, so there is. There is something there. I. I am still also learning. But for me it is for you. For the purpose of this work is like. For let it be a guide for us not necessarily following the principles of the ones who designed it. Like ask as they are without trying to explain plain. And then that's not it. Because one I am. I'm going to translate it. I'm not going to ask it in English because the person doesn't know English. Even the one who knows English. English is not.
 
Speaker B: [54:55]
Yeah.
 
Speaker A: [54:57]
Yeah. So being a GUID and sometimes giving it time can give accurate scores than administering it as it is.
 
Speaker B: [55:18]
Thank you. So, in. In. In. In a. As we conclude. So what Is there a particular story or moment or lesson that you feel captures that your heart as a therapist?
 
Speaker A: [55:39]
There are many stories.
 
Speaker B: [55:40]
But which one can get me one which stands out? One which would describe peace as a therapist.
 
Speaker A: [55:49]
Hey.
 
Speaker B: [55:53]
What her journey has been like? What. What really stands out? Which moments? The ones which capture your heart.
 
Speaker A: [56:03]
May you. II can you give me a hint if it's okay?
 
Speaker B: [56:10]
Maybe when you speak of the you said they. How do they describe you? How do you clients as appear as a calm person?
 
Speaker A: [56:18]
Ah, yes. Come, come princess. And I I remember one, one gentleman who was a parent of my client who said, I have never seen someone who is calm, articulate. And I forgotten the third, like having those three principles in one person. He said, I have not seen that. So but for many calmness and principle principled in the African culture to mean if I, I keep time and if I have said I don't receive calls beyond nine, I will really not. So that is the principle. I mean like sticking to my values. That's what people describe as principled. And then honest. Bland, actually. Yeah. So I now to answer your question is there are clients who find it a challenge to work with me because I am very honest. Like when someone you know, people come to counseling expecting to be comfort, to be flattered, to be. And for me, that's not my approach. My approach is, for example, for mostly couples where like someone is crying, I will say mostly ladies. And because I've come to a lady, they expect expect me to also join them in identify with belittling men or saying men are what. And they only get surprised when I also turn to them and show them how they are contributing to the issues in their family or how they are having an. They are having unrealistic expectations and that's the reason affecting them. And by naming them and how I usually do it is, is like logically. Logically, like I ask a question and then you will answer yourself, but with embarrassment because it's a fact. So I have had clients who have problems working with me like that because for them, they prefer hearing what they.
 
Speaker B: [59:11]
Want to hear they want to hear.
 
Speaker A: [59:14]
And that is not me. Then I have had those who, yeah, they like it like not beating about the bush or giving them false hope or comforting them where I should be. I should be showing them reality.
 
Speaker B: [59:41]
Okay. Thank you so much for your time and the creating time. Still by the same time sharing your experience, but more so having the heart of a therapist. Yeah, it's still new. We still have a lot to do, but and then for finalists. So discovering the passion. But it's according to two to do the kind of work you're doing. So we appreciate and thank you so much.
